Below is a list of the high-level requirements for your hash table, which you’ll be implementing now. By the end of this section, your hash table will exhibit the following core features. It’ll let you:

- Create an empty hash table
- Insert a key-value pair to the hash table
- Delete a key-value pair from the hash table
- Find a value by key in the hash table
- Update the value associated with an existing key
- Check if the hash table has a given key

In addition to these, you’ll implement a few nonessential but still useful features. Specifically, you should be able to:

- Create a hash table from a Python dictionary
- Create a shallow copy of an existing hash table
- Return a default value if the corresponding key is not found
- Report the number of key-value pairs stored in the hash table
- Return the keys, values, and key-value pairs
- Make the hash table iterable
- Make the hash table comparable by using the equality test operator
- Show a textual representation of the hash table
